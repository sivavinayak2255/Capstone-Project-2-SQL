### SQL Capstone Project <br/>
I have worked on a real-time Airline Database case study, where you were required to analyze data and extract meaningful insights. The database contained multiple tables, such as Flights, Passengers, Bookings, Airports, and Crew, with relationships between them.<br/><br/>
Joining multiple tables to combine relevant information.
Using CASE statements to create conditional logic within queries.
Implementing loop statements for iterative tasks (if using procedural SQL like PL/SQL).
Applying Window Functions to perform advanced calculations, such as running totals, ranking, and moving averages.<br/><br/>
Used JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to merge data from multiple tables efficiently.
Implemented CASE statements to categorize data based on conditions (e.g., flight status, customer segmentation).
Used LOOP statements (if applicable in PL/SQL or procedural SQL) to automate repetitive tasks.
Applied Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, SUM OVER(), AVG OVER(), etc.) to derive insights from grouped data.
Ensured query optimization by using indexing, filtering, and avoiding unnecessary computations.<br/><br/>
Successfully executed 95% of queries with high accuracy, ensuring correct and optimized results.
Improved database querying skills, making data retrieval more efficient.
Gained hands-on experience in solving real-world airline industry problems using SQL.
